# Dad Dinner

## Description

We've created an application that enhances the lives of busy parents everywhere and takes the stress out of the long asked question "What's for dinner?". Just search for your main ingredient on the homepage and choose to randomize it if you're feeling like an adventure. 



## Usage
Just type an ingredient in the search bar and be taken to a list of recipes featuring that ingredient, along with an ingredient list for any additional needs. Click on the thumbnail and you'll be taken to the recipe's website featuring that recipe, with instructions. If you're feeling like trying something new click the randomize button and be suprised tonight. You don't even have to worry about entertaining the kids, we've got that covered with Dad jokes on demand, an endless random supply at your finger tips.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
